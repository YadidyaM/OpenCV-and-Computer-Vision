# YOLOv8 Boat Detection

**Introduction**

This repository contains the implementation of a YOLOv11 object detection model specifically trained to detect boats in aerial drone maritime images.


**Model Architecture**

The model is based on the YOLOv11 architecture, a state-of-the-art object detection framework. It utilizes a deep neural network to efficiently process input images and generate accurate predictions.

**Inference**

To perform inference on a new image:

1. **Prepare the Image:** Ensure the image is in the correct format (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and size.
2. **Load the Model:** Load the trained YOLOv8 model.
3. **Perform Inference:** Pass the image through the model to obtain the predicted bounding boxes and class probabilities.
4. **Visualize Results:** Visualize the detected boats on the original image.
