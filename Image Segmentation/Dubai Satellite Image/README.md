# Dubai Satellite Image Segmentation

This project focuses on satellite image segmentation of Dubai using Patchify for data preparation and TensorFlow for deep learning-based segmentation models.

## Overview

Satellite image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful information from satellite imagery. This repository demonstrates how to perform image segmentation specifically for Dubai using deep learning techniques.

### Key Components

- **Patchify**: A Python library used to efficiently extract image patches from large satellite images. This helps in handling large datasets effectively during training and evaluation.
  
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for building and training deep neural networks. TensorFlow is used here to implement and train the image segmentation model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YadidyaM/Dubai-Satellite-Image-Segmentation.git
   cd Dubai-Satellite-Image-Segmentation
   ```
